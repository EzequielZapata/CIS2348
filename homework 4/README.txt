THESE ARE MY LABS FROM ZYLAB FOR HOMEWORK 4

I HAVE UPLOADED ZYLAB 12.7, 12.9, 14.11, AND 14.13

14.13 I HAD THE MOST STRUGGLE WITH SINCE I DID NOT REALLY KNOW HOW TO APPROACH IT OR WHAT I WAS DOING WRONG. I AT LEAST MADE THE FIRST GOT
THE FIRST OUTPUT TO WORK FINE, BUT THE REST I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.

I TRIED MY BEST.
